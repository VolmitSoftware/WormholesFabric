--------------------
### This is **Wormholes**

Wormholes is a recreation of the Spigot plugin Wormholes but now using the **ImmersivePortals API  
*Please note that this mod is merely a proof of concept at this stage, but all blocks have crafting recipes and are in the creative tab "wormholes" and the mod is* **intended for Survival usage at the end of the day.**

**Demo Videos:**

### **Quick Start Guide:**
1: Craft/Get the Portal frame blocks.
2: Craft/Get the wand.  
3: Make the portal Frame.  
4: Wand Usage- Right-Click = Set frames. Shift-Right clears the wand Selections, and Sneak-Shift-Right clicking a portal flips the orientations depending on your viewing angle  
5: Click both portals to link  
6: Profit.

About the Frames: Please note that this was built with odd frames intended, (1,3,5,7,9 etc...) but work with even scales, they may just need to be remade a few times to get the orientation correct. As the orientation the portal is facing is dependent on YOUR direction to the center of the frame. (So if you are too low it will be below, and if you are too high, it'll be too high and you will wither see no portal on one end or like an upside down square etc...) Breaking the frame, breaks all portals  
- The same can happen when trying to find the "middle" of the even blocks, but that should just pose a sleight offset.  
- The Frame needs to be complete! (NO MISSING CORNERS)

### **How to Avoid Problems:**
- Use "Even Frames"
- Look Directly at your portal (Your facing Direction is important)
- Be on Latest.
